## Overview
This is my first project that I am doing alone and not coding along with someone. I was able to demonstrate my capabilites that I was up for the task.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I first started by adding the materials to the html and proceeded to style it. This was my first project I did all on my own and I did have to look a few things up such as "how to make an active button". All in all, everything came out pretty well. Some minor knit picks here and there but I am satisfied with my first project.
### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- CSS custom properties
- images and fonts provided



### What I learned

I learned to trust in my abilty to problem solve and not to be afraid to look things up. I learned that anchors and buttons act differently and have to be coded differently. The best take away from this was learning new forms of code that I didn't know prior. You never stop learning in this profession and for that I enjoy it.

### Continued development

I would like to be better at postioning the elements better. They aren't the worse but could have a little touch ups here and there. I want to be able to more complex projects to further better myself.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with the image and button issues I was having and will be refering to it in the future.
